                    Fiber based photonics, Quantum optics, Light-matter Interactions and Time crystals. Some projects are reading projects, while others are experimental. 
                    These projects have helped me not only gain exposure in repective fields but also has given me insight about scienctific methods and way of rational

              <div class="block bg-transparent text-white">
                <p><span class="first-character sc">W</span>ith the advent of advanced cooling techniques, new areas of studies using neutral atoms opened up. An 
                  optical dipole trap serves as a reservoir for single atoms, which can be used to precisely load a tweezer. These atoms can further be used as 
                  sensors, by exciting them to their Rydberg states. An array of such atoms can be used to simulate quantum systems as well as many-body physics. 
                  These arrays have also been proposed to be used as a quantum processor with each of the atoms acting like a qubit. Gate operations using these arrays
                  have been reported and advancements are being made. Getting exposed to the techniques and participating in experiemnt of such calibre was the aim of 
                  this project.
